# Ticket nr 5555

In turbo_chatroom app users has been sending other users some unwanted messages.
We have message_analyzer python backend that has been used successfully in other projects to sanitize messages - we want to use it here to do the same.
It can be run easily with docker, with POST requests sent to /analyze endpoint.
